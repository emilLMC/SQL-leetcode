197. Rising Temperature 

Note: Since there is a need to check previous value on the same table did a self join and then did date sub to check for previous date 
while joining and then defined wherre condition to check the < temp

Difficulty rating: EASY 

My solution : 

SELECT w1.id
FROM weather w
JOIN weather w1 ON w.recorddate = DATE_SUB(w1.recorddate, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
WHERE w.temperature < w1.temperature;
