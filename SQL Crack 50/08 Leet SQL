1581 Customer who visited but Did not make any transaction
My NOTE :
Interesting question wasted some time on this but its easier to break the question and then think about it !!
As in first understand what join is best suitable to give you the desired table that helps with the comparision and then filter out based on your need

DIFFICULTY RATING : EASY

My Solution:
SELECT customer_id,count(customer_id) as "count_no_trans"
FROM visits v LEFT JOIN transactions t
ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
WHERE transaction_id is null
GROUP BY customer_id
